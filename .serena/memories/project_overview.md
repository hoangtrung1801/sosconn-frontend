# Project Overview

## Purpose
SOSConn is designed to become a “digital command center” in emergency situations in Vietnam, connecting government, rescue forces, and communities on a unified platform. The system provides comprehensive support across three stages: preparation before disasters, response during disasters, and review & improvement after disasters, leveraging artificial intelligence and real-time data.

## Project Name
- Package name: SOSConn
- Actual purpose: An intelligent digital platform that supports management, coordination, and optimization of responses to natural disasters, epidemics, and other emergencies.
- Target: Central government, local authorities, rescue forces, humanitarian organizations, and communities.
- Language: Vietnamese

## Key features
- **Dynamic digital map & data visualization**: Displays disaster data layers, SOS points, rescue team locations, and available resources.
- **Multi-channel early warning system**: Sends alerts via app, SMS, and email with tailored action guidance.
- **AI Agent for Emergency Operation Plan (EOP)**: Automatically generates emergency response plans including objectives, scenarios, assignments, evacuation routes, and contingency strategies.
- **Interactive AI Chatbot**: Citizens can ask questions about disaster risks and receive preparedness advice.
- **Intelligent resource coordination**: Optimizes task assignment, deployment of personnel, and resource allocation in real-time.
- **Two-way community communication**: Citizens can submit incident reports with location, photos, or videos directly to the command center.
- **Data repository & event logs**: Stores all response information for later review, analysis, and improvement.
- **Automated post-event analysis & policy support**: AI summarizes and visualizes data, extracts lessons learned, and supports policy-making.

## Problem solved
- Addresses the **lack of a unified system** for emergency management and coordination in Vietnam.
- **Reduces disaster damage** through early warnings, rapid planning, and optimized resource allocation.
- **Enhances transparency & connectivity** between government, rescue teams, and communities.
- **Supports long-term policymaking** with post-event data analysis.
- Promotes **digital transformation in disaster management** and can be extended to other emergencies (epidemics, mass accidents, infrastructure failures).
